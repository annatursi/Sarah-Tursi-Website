        <h1 class="search">College Planning</h1>
        <p>The four years of high school are short, but the lasting impact of the decisions made during them can remain for a lifetime. Each year offers specific challenges, and it is important to establish a roadmap for how to navigate both academic needs and college planning concurrently.</p>
        <p>Your child needs to be nurtured to identify their strengths, self-motivation, and good college fit. Schools and outside prep centers cannot offer guidance in balancing your child's academic self, relational self, and emotional self.</p>
        <p>The key to overcoming family conflict regarding desired academic performance, motivation, grades, college choice, and pending adulthood often involves having a third party mediate and guide the situation. Sarah can support you through this process and help your teen reach their full potential.</p>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-med-3 col-sm-3">
            <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
            <p>The first year of high school is all about choices, joining and defining who your child aspires to be for the next four years.</p>
          <p>Your child needs to set and achieve academic, relational, and school-wide goals to have a smooth transition to high school and set the stage for future decisions.</p>
          <p>Sarah will establish a clear path for your family's next four years.</p>

            <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
            <p>Sophomore year builds on the academic and personal foundation you laid during freshman year.</p>
            <p>Your child has an established high school transcript with grades that directly impact college acceptance. Additionally, they are anticipating the transition to driving and possibly working for the first time. With these new found freedoms and independence comes anxiety and tension within families.</p>
          <p>Sarah Tursi will guide conversations regarding motivation, independence, trust, and appropriate limit setting.</p>

              <h2>Junior Year</h2>
          <p>Junior year is unquestionably the most difficult year of high school.</p>
          <p>Increased demands from academic rigor, extracurricular activities, and academic testing can lead to high stress and sleep deprevation, increased social activity can create anxiety, uncertainty, and, at times, depressive feelings in even the highest-functioning adolescents.</p>
          <p>Sarah will provide nurturing support and clear direction for your family through this busiest year.</p>

              <h2>Senior Year</h2>
              <p>Starting in the summer before senior year, the college application process begins, and families prepare for a member to launce into adulthood. The pressure of college selection and transition from home weighs heavily on every family member from the beginning of the application process through graduations.
               <p>Sarah will advise your child to select colleges that are truly a good fit for their whole person and gather the insights to write strong, introspective application essays that will lead to a lifetime of success.</p>

        <h1 class="search">College Student Support</h1>
        <p>This transition to independence can be fraught with anxiety and uncertainty along with sadness about leaving dear friends and family. This difficulty can be further complicated by feeling college is not as spectacular as anticipated. Many students report feelings of depression and anxiety, and some need to return home.</p>
        <p>Sarah Tursi will engage students away at school via remote sessions and during school vacations in office to help them better evaluate their emotional needs during this transitional time.</p>

        <h1 class="search">Transition to Adulthood</h1>
        <p>Turning 18 marks the onset of adult responsibility. For many young adults, this onset is delayed until college graduation and sometimes long after. Every new adult faces challenges in setting the foundation for their independent life. Issues with relationships, emancipation, and financial independence can create anxiety and tension that can be resolved with the support of a therapist.
          <p>Sarah will reason through life goals and transitions to help establish strategies for a strong adult foundation.</p>
